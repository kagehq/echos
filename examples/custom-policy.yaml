# Example Echos Policy Configuration
# Save this to ~/.echos/echos.yaml

# Actions that are automatically allowed
allow:
  - "llm.chat:.*"              # Allow all LLM chat requests
  - "http.request:https://api.openai.com/.*"  # Allow OpenAI API
  - "http.request:https://api.anthropic.com/.*"  # Allow Anthropic API

# Actions that require user confirmation
ask:
  - "slack.post:.*"            # Always ask before posting to Slack
  - "email.send:.*"            # Always ask before sending emails
  - "http.request:https://hooks.slack.com/.*"  # Ask before webhooks
  - "fs.delete:.*important.*"  # Ask before deleting important files

# Actions that are always blocked
block:
  - "fs.delete:/etc/.*"        # Block system file deletion
  - "fs.delete:/var/.*"        # Block var directory deletion
  - "email.send:.*@competitor.com"  # Block emails to competitors
  - "slack.post:#exec-.*"      # Block posts to executive channels

# Optional: Send Slack alerts for certain actions
# slackWebhook: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"

# Tips:
# - Patterns use regex: .* matches anything, \\. matches literal dot
# - Format is "intent:target" where target is optional
# - First matching rule wins (order: block, ask, allow)
# - Edit this file anytime - daemon reloads automatically
